            We make it simple for existing groups to make self-sovereign digital
            spaces that are owned and evolvable by the group itself.
            <br />
            <br />
            We build software for ourselves and the groups we're a part of, taking
            care that it be easily adaptable for and by others.
            <br />
            <br />
            darksoil applications make it easier to see and engage with more nuance
            and acuity to do/create/have more of what we want with our groups with
            less administrative burden.
            <br />
            <br />
            We test our software with our communities; our farms, villages, movement
            collectives, hackerspaces, businesses, cooperatives, friend groups, etc.
            We need the things we're building because it's a headache that we don't
            already have them. When what we build works for our communities, we
            partner with people to adapt and integrate it to work for their
            communities.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sometimes, when we're inspired by the partnership, we make things for
            others before we make them for ourselves.
