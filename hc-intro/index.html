          <p> 
            <li>Live and interactive teaching sessions with one of the worlds premier Holochain developers</li>
            <li>Top-class interactive educational material</li>
            <li>Intimate cohort of experienced developers</li>

          <h4>Learn to build web3 apps</h4>
          <p>Holochain is an open-source protocol for developing peer-to-peer applications. It is set to provide a large piece of the puzzle towards bringing the vision of web3 into the world. The protocol allows for highly modular development of local-first functionality that can be combined into fully featured cryptographically secure applications. It creates a fundamental layer for creating a new robust, resilient and sovereign technological infrastructure.</p>
            
          <h4>Outcomes</h4>
          <p>At the end of the program, you'll be able to:
            <li>Work as a Holochain developer</li>
            <li>Have a basic understanding of the distributed systems architecture of Holochain</li>
            <li>Make and distribute simple Holochain applications (hApps)</li>
          </p>
            
          <h4>Course Pre-requiste</h4>
          <p><b>Basic Rust</b><br />
          In order for you to receive full value from this course, you should already have experience with coding using Rust. While most of holochain apps can be coded in Javascript using your preferred front end frameworks, some of the core Holochain functionality and integrity requires Rust, therefore familiarity with Rust is important in order to complete this course. 
          </p>
