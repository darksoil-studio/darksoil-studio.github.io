              <p>Holochain is an open-source protocol for developing peer-to-peer applications.</p> 
              <p>The protocol allows for modular development of local-first functionality and fully featured cryptographically secure applications.</p>
              <p>Holochain can be used to build robust, resilient and sovereign technological infrastructure.</p>
              <p><a href="https://developer.holochain.org/">Learn more about it here.</a></p>
          -->
          

          <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">Outcomes</h3>
          
              <p>At the end of the program, you can:
            <li style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">Make simple Holochain apps</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">Work as a Holochain developer</li>
            <li style="font-size: 20px; text-align: left;">Understand the basics of Holochain architecture</li>
          </p>

              <h4 slot="title">Basic Rust</h4>
            <p>In order for you to receive full value from this course, you must already have experience coding in Rust.</p>
            <p>While most of a holochain app can be coded in Javascript using your preferred front end frameworks, Rust is required for the core Holochain functionality and integrity.

          <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">Program Components</h3>
          
              <h4>Lectures</h4>
              <p>The lectures will break down the concepts and materials in an engaging way with live visualizations.</p>
              <p>Guillem will be walking you through the different elements of the course and giving clear illustrations of how Holochain works</p>
            
              <h4>Exercises</h4>
              <p>Throughout the course, there are plenty of individual and group exercises along the way.</p>
              <p>These exercises are built into the interactive learning materials to make sure that all of the concepts land for you as a student</p>
            
              <h4>Mini-hackathon</h4>
              <p>At the end of the course you will have time to build a very small app in order to get familiar with the actual process of building.</p>
              <p>This will be using scaffolding tools and we will provide you with a few different app designs to choose from to implement.</p>
           
  
          <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">Course Details</h3>
          
              <h4 slot="title">Overview</h4>
              <p>This training will run over the course of two weeks beginning on Monday the 3rd of February. </p>
              <p>Each day has around <b>2 hours of theory</b> on zoom and then there are exercises to complete before the next session (expect around 2h for this depending on person and skill). </p>
              <p>The live sessions will be held at: <br />
              <b>8 am PST / 11 am EST / 6pm CEST</b> </p>
              <p>After we have gone through all the theory, you get to practice it through implementing a small app (we provide a few different designs to choose from) in the hackathon days.</p>
              <p>During the two weeks after the course we will give ongoing asynchronous support for students that are building things and at the end of these two weeks we also offer a live session where we answer any questions or considerations that might have come up in building. </p>
