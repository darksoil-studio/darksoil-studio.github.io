      <p>
        We want digital tools that are first and foremost a way for people to get their needs met outside of the digital world. For us that means building small, interoperable, fully distributed apps that enable groups to capture and ground emergent properties for organizing, collaborating, and connecting.  
        <br>
        <br>
        When we create open-source software, we are careful to build directly for contexts that are asking for the software that we are building, in direct relationship with the users. Not imaginary users. This way of working ensures that we create things that are wanted in the world. We hope it also makes it easier to orient towards meeting real needs, rather than manufactured ones. As we build the tools we take care to architect and design them in such a way that they can be easily adapted for and by other users and communities. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our goal is to utilize a network effect, not by monopolizing other peoples social graphs, but by letting real world social groups mirror themselves online and supplying them with increasingly useful software to cohere. An introductory article on this perspective can be found <a href="https://zaunders.medium.com/distributed-online-life-1dd64e7474ec">here</a>.

        When we create software, we are careful to build directly for contexts that are asking for the software that we are building. This way of working ensures that we create things that are wanted in the world. However, as we build the tools we take care to architect and design them in such a way that they will be useful outside of the target context that we are building for. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Along with the creation of the software, we spend a lot of time relating the stories of why we are building the things we are building and making sure that we make explicit how we aim to be of service both to the Holochain ecosystem but also to the larger planetary whole that we are all a part of.

      <p>
        At darksoil we want to create the best possible open source software to empower groups to function more joyously and harmoniously together. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our aim is to be able to use the amazing power of the Holochain framework so that people can freely create groups and use all of the powerful modular tools that we are developing as they please. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We want to offer these tools to everyone who sees that they can enrich themselves and the larger systems they are a part of freely. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In order for us to be able to continue to do so we seek reciprocity from the communities that benefit and from any person or organization that can see the value that we are creating.
        <br>
        <br>
        We have set up an <a href="https://opencollective.com/darksoil">open collective</a> as an efficient and transparent way to receive financial support for the work we are doing. If the way we are working towards a regenerative human presence on the planet resonates with you, please consider making a small or large, one time or recurring contribution to <a href="https://opencollective.com/darksoil">our collective</a>. You can contribute generally to our work or to an individual project directly. 
        <br>
        <br>
        All of our work is transparently invoiced to the collective and visible on the open collective page so you can see directly what your support is enabling.
