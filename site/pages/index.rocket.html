        We build small, interoperable, fully distributed apps that enable groups to access emergent properties for organizing, collaborating, and connecting. We build open source software on Holochain. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We also build tools to increase the accessibility and functionality of the Holochain core codebase.

        We make it simple for existing groups to make self-sovereign digital spaces that are owned and evolvable by the group itself.   
        <br>
        <br>
        We build software for ourselves and the groups we’re a part of, taking care that it be easily adaptable for and by others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        darksoil applications make it easier to see and engage with more nuance and acuity to do/create/have more of what we want with our groups with less administrative burden.
        <br>
        <br>
        We test our software with our communities; our farms, villages, movement collectives, hackerspaces, businesses, cooperatives, friend groups, etc. We need the things we’re building because it’s a headache that we don’t already have them. When what we build works for our communities, we partner with people to adapt and integrate it to work for their communities.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, when we’re inspired by the partnership, we make things for others before we make them for ourselves.

      <p>
        At darksoil we want to create the best possible open source software to empower groups to function more joyously and harmoniously together. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our aim is to be able to use the amazing power of the Holochain framework so that people can freely create groups and use all of the powerful modular tools that we are developing as they please. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We want to offer these tools to everyone who sees that they can enrich themselves and the larger systems they are a part of freely. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In order for us to be able to continue to do so we seek reciprocity from the communities that benefit and from any person or organization that can see the value that we are creating.
        <br>
        <br>
        We have set up an <a href="https://opencollective.com/darksoil">open collective</a> as an efficient and transparent way to receive financial support for the work we are doing. If the way we are working towards a regenerative human presence on the planet resonates with you, please consider making a small or large, one time or recurring contribution to <a href="https://opencollective.com/darksoil">our collective</a>. You can contribute generally to our work or to an individual project directly. 
        <br>
        <br>
        All of our work is transparently invoiced to the collective and visible on the open collective page so you can see directly what your support is enabling.
