      <p>
        We make tools for people to grow deep dark soil, ecologically and socially.
        <br>
        <br>
        We build small, interoperable, fully distributed apps that enable groups to access emergent properties for organizing, collaborating, and connecting. We build open source software on Holochain.

      <h2 id="how-we-work" link-text="How We Work">approach to making software</h2>
      <p>
        As we architect and build tools for people in place-based communities, we take care that our software be easily adapted for and by others.   
        <br>
        <br>
        Our applications help groups access the dynamics and nuances that matter to them in their digital spaces. This enables us to see and engage with each other and our respective groups with more acuity and less administrative burden to make more of what we want happen. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our software works with a network effect, not in the usual sense of monopolizing other people’s social graphs, but by allowing existing networks of people to see and engage with themselves in richer ways. On a darksoil app your social reality doesn’t live in someone else’s custody, but in your own. When you have a group of people coming together with this kind of agency, new properties and possibilities for the individuals and group’s expression emerge.
        <br>
        <br>
        We seek and foster systems that are conducive to growing trust in and accountability to ourselves, each other and the places we live. All of the meaningful change that we work towards requires an increase in trust between people so growing trust is at the heart of what we want our applications to support. People connected through trust is the social soil that thriving communities come alive from.

        <br />
        A tool for groups to purchase food directly from producers with as little overhead for both parties as possible. This way of sourcing food is built on trust and builds trust. Both in the groups that start using this tool and between the producers and us as customers. These relationships are what enable us to bring our values into our food supply.

      <p>
        At darksoil we want to create the best possible open source software to empower groups to function more joyously and harmoniously together. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our aim is to be able to use the amazing power of the Holochain framework so that people can freely create groups and use all of the powerful modular tools that we are developing as they please. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We want to offer these tools to everyone who sees that they can enrich themselves and the larger systems they are a part of freely. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In order for us to be able to continue to do so we seek reciprocity from the communities that benefit and from any person or organization that can see the value that we are creating.
        <br>
        <br>
        We have set up an <a href="https://opencollective.com/darksoil">open collective</a> as an efficient and transparent way to receive financial support for the work we are doing. If the way we are working towards a regenerative human presence on the planet resonates with you, please consider making a small or large, one time or recurring contribution to <a href="https://opencollective.com/darksoil">our collective</a>. You can contribute generally to our work or to an individual project directly. 
        <br>
        <br>
        All of our work is transparently invoiced to the collective and visible on the open collective page so you can see directly what your support is enabling.
