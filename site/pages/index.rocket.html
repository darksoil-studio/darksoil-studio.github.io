            We make it simple for existing groups to make self-sovereign digital
            spaces that are owned and evolvable by the group itself.
            <br />
            <br />
            We build software for ourselves and the groups we’re a part of,
            taking care that it be easily adaptable for and by others.
            <br />
            <br />
            darksoil applications make it easier to see and engage with more
            nuance and acuity to do/create/have more of what we want with our
            groups with less administrative burden.
            <br />
            <br />
            We test our software with our communities; our farms, villages,
            movement collectives, hackerspaces, businesses, cooperatives, friend
            groups, etc. We need the things we’re building because it’s a
            headache that we don’t already have them. When what we build works
            for our communities, we partner with people to adapt and integrate
            it to work for their communities.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sometimes, when we’re inspired by the partnership, we make things
            for others before we make them for ourselves.

            He has been foundational for teaching the growing Holochain dev

            Matthias develops beautiful applications and modules for darksoil.
            <br /><br />
            He is one of the main contributors to the Holochain
            <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">launcher</a> and the
            membrane management tool
            <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a>. He examines
            fundamental assumptions and explores their implications in detail in
            projects he is working with to ensure they are as sound and stable
            as possible. <br /><br />
            He recently became aware of the fact that once he dies, the
            molecules his body is comprised of will become part of the world
            around him. Which is why he intends to create the world he will be
            looking forward dying into.
